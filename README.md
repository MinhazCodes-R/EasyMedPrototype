# Frontendu

A web-based frontend application designed for seamless interaction with a backend API and a connected PostgreSQL database. This project is set up for rapid development and easy deployment, with Dockerized database support.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name/frontendu
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontendu/` directory and add your environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

Adjust these values to match your local or Docker-based setup.

## 🐳 Database Setup (PostgreSQL with Docker)

This project expects a PostgreSQL database to be running. If you don’t already have one, you can quickly spin it up using Docker:

```bash
docker run --name postgres-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=mydb \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  -d postgres
```

Once the container is running, make sure your `.env` file's `DATABASE_URL` matches the connection info (host, port, db name, user, password).

## 🛠️ Available Scripts
